In the spirit of Manning’s in Action books, we showed you two real, standalone
applications, Indexer and Searcher, which are capable of indexing and searching text
files stored in a file system. We then briefly described each of the Lucene classes used
in these two applications.
 Search is everywhere, and chances are that if you’re reading this book, you’re interested
in search becoming an integral part of your applications. Depending on your needs,
integrating Lucene may be trivial, or it may involve challenging architectural considerations.
 We’ve organized the next couple of chapters as we did this chapter. The first thing
we need to do is index some documents; we discuss this process next in detail in
chapter 2.
